# SNHU CS-300
DSA: Analysis and Design
## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
I was building a program to read and organize course data, allowing users to search for courses, view prerequisites, and see a sorted list of course offerings. The challenge was to design a structure that efficiently stored and retrieved course information.

## How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I broke the problem down into manageable parts—loading the file, storing data, and creating menu options. I used a binary search tree for sorting and quick lookup, which helped me understand the importance of choosing the right data structure for efficiency.

## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I ran into issues with file parsing and tree traversal logic. I reviewed the logic step-by-step, used print statements for debugging, and adjusted my recursion to ensure the tree was built and printed correctly.

## How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This project taught me to think more intentionally about program structure, modular design, and flow. It helped me see the value of separating concerns—for example, keeping data handling, user interaction, and logic in their own functions.

## How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I started writing cleaner code with more comments and consistent formatting. I also focused on using descriptive names and structuring functions so that future updates—like adding new menu options—would be easier to implement.
